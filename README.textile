h1. Using ZeeShell-Config
- clone this repo. don't forget to git submodule init (the zshkit is a submod)
- Assume downloaded to $HOME/.zsh (to be fixed. not really a problem for me right now)
- cd .zsh
- source install.sh
- if you have .zshrc or .zshenv in your $HOME it will back them up. 
- thanks.
